# receptive_field_development
Developmental model of orientation selective receptive fields based on Miller 1994


Correlation based approach to model the development of orientation selective receptive fields in visual cortex following Miller 1994 (https://www.jneurosci.org/content/14/1/409.short). It is assumed that segregation of receptive fields happens due to competition between inputs of ON and OFF cells in LGN via a Hebbian plasticity rule.

TODO: add different normalisation schemes, so far only one is implemented
